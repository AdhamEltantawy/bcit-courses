here is how I have organized my files:

d_*.c	// c files I wrote

d_*.h	// header files relating to co-responding 
d_*.c file (see d.h for inclusion info)


d.h	// header file that includes all my other header files (so you only need to include this one, but all others must exist)


s.h	// functions I need Steffen to implement

k.h	// functions I need Kyle to implement

e.h	// functions I need Eddie to implement

m.h	// functions I need Max to implement
