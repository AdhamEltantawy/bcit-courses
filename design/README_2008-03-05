I made some changes to a couple diagrams, mainly the thread splitting but
I'll explain that tomorrow, can't be buggered to explain it in text.
I put a few diagrams into DIA with slight updates, gonna have a go at a few more.
The pencil on the hand-drawn ones is too light to scan properly, so I might as well.


Pseudocode Breakdown (just look off of the png images):
Brendan - Client Main & Server Regular Server Connection
They're basically the same but inverted for the client and server.  
Should just be a basic switch statement based on what kind of
message you get.

Jerrod - The server & client side of microphone, although this may need some
changing since we aren't doing sequence numbers anymore.

Steffen - Multicast Server.  Just one diagram because this one is more complex
than the others and doesn't have a "mirror image" equivalent.


That's it for now, the rest may take some updating so we'll have like a 10-minute
meetup at a break or sometime to get it sorted, and I'll post an update
following that.

And I'll post the dates as well just to make it official:
Monday - Design work due
- Meeting at 11 A.M.
Following Saturday - Individual Code Sections
Jerrod: Multimedia (function takes buffer in parameter & plays the music it contains)
Steffen: GUI mock-up
Brendan & I: Circular buffer
