Write a preprocessor directive to accomplish each of the folowing:
   1) Define symbolic constant YES to have the value 1.

#define YES 1

   2) Define symbolic constant NO to have the value 0.

#define NO 0

   3) Include the header common.h.  The header is found in the same directory as the file being compiled.

#include "common.h"

   4) Renumber the remaining lines in the beginning with the line number 3000.

#line 3000

   5) If symbolic constant TRUE is defined, undefine it and redefine it as 1. Do NOT use the #ifdef preprocessor directive.

#if defined TRUE
  #undef TRUE
  #define TRUE 1
#endif

   6) If symbolic constant TRUE is defined, undefine it and redefine it as 1. Use the #ifdef preprocessor directive.

#ifdef TRUE
  #undef TRUE
  #define TRUE 1
#endif
