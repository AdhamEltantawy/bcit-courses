1. Problem 10.5 Page 433 of the text.

Provide the definition for each of the following structures and unions:

a) Structure "inventory" containing character array partName[ 30 ], integer partNumber, floating point price, integer stock and integer reorder.

b) Union data containing char c, short s, long b, float f and double d.

c) A structure called address that contains character arrays streetAddress[ 25 ], city[ 20 ], state[ 3 ] and zipCode[ 6 ].

d) Stucture student that contains arrays firstNAme[ 15 ] and lastName[ 15 ] and field (also called a member) homeAddress of type "struct address" from part c) above.

e) Structure test containing 16 bit fields with widths of 1 bit.  The names of the bit fields are the letters a to p.

2. Problem 10.10 Page 434 of the text.

Write a program that right shifts an integer variable 4 bits. The program should print the integer in bits before and after the shift operation.  Does your system place 0s or 1s in the vacated bits?

3. Problem 10.12 Page 435 of the text.

Left shifting an unsigned integer by 1 bit is equivalant to multiplying the value by 2.  Write function Power2() that takes 2 integer arguements number and pow and calculates 

   number * 2 (to the power of pow)

USe the shift operator to calculate the result.  Print the values as integers and as bits.
