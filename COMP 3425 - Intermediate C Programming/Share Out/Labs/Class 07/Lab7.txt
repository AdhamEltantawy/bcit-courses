Write a preprocessor directive to accomplish each of the folowing:
   1) Define symbolic constant YES to have the value 1.
   2) Define symbolic constant NO to have the value 0.
   3) Include the header common.h.  The header is found in the same directory as the file being compiled.
   4) Renumber the remaining lines in the beginning with the line number 3000.
   5) If symbolic constant TRUE is defined, undefine it and redefine it as 1. Do NOT use the #ifdef preprocessor directive.
   6) If symbolic constant TRUE is defined, undefine it and redefine it as 1. Use the #ifdef preprocessor directive.
   7) If symbolic constant TRUE is not equal to 0, define symbolic constant FALSE as 0.  Otherwise define FALSE as 1.
   8) Define macro CUBE_VOLUME that computes the volume of a cube.  The macro takes one argument.
