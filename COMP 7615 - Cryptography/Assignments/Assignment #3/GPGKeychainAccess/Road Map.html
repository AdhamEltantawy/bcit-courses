<h1>Developer's Roadmap</h1>
<p>05 January 2005</p>

<p>This document provides a development scheme for GPG Keychain Access. This scheme is rough, as it does not anticipate any external changes to the computing environment in which it will be developed or used. Changes in that computing environment will neccesitate changes to this roadmap.</p>

<p>With the release of version 0.7.0, development of GPG Keychain Access will split into two branches. The first branch, 0.7, will be a maintenance branch that maintains compatibility with Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), while the second branch, 0.8 and its decendents will be compatable with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and will contain new features.</p>

<h2>0.6.1: Current Version</h2>

<h2>0.7: January 2005</h2>
<ul>
<li>GUI to control key generation</li>
<li>Online help</li>
<li>Partial Address Book support</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.8: Summer 2005</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full Address Book support</li>
<li>iCal support</li>
<li>GUI for some key editing</li>
<li>Migrate all key manipulation functions from Terminal.app to GPGME or pipes</li>
<li>New GUI for key importing and exporting</li>
<li>GPG->Import Key system service</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the application will be refactored to make future maintainance easier and quicker, particularly the updating of translations. In the fall of 2004, GPGME 1.0 was released and this verison of GPGME will be incorporated into GPG Keychain Access and other products of the MacGPG project, leading to significantly improved performance. Work on GPG Keychain Access 0.8 will wait on the production of GPGME.framework 1.0.</p>

<h2>1.0: Autumn 2005</h2>
<ul>
<li>Additional key editing using GUI mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.1: Winter or Spring 2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a key signing party helper of some sort?</li>
</ul>
