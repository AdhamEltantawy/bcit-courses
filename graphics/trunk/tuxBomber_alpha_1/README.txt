There is not much to say about the project so far. This folder contains the code from 
lasyFoo sdl tutorials website. It has been modified to fit the Tux Bomber requirements.
It is a very rough draft so please don't come to me and say things like: The file is to long...
You are using a shitload of globals... Your indentaton is wrong. I modified it so people can understand
easier how things are loaded, how collision is detected and so on. 
I want to thank Brendan for showing me the tutorial that gave birth to this. 
Also guys when I start to work on something I tend to go on and on with it so if I am getting to far ahead 
please tell me: Slow Down.

email me @ aalbu@my.bcit.ca if you have any questions.

PS: The  map that the game is curently using is: lazy.map
    lazy.map is autogenerated when the game starts and it is random.
