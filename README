SVN Repository Layout
=====================

Trunk:
------
Trunk would be the main body of development, originating from the start
of the project until the present. There is only one version of the code
living in the trunk at any one point in time, the latest version.

Branches:
---------
Branches will be a copy of code derived from a certain point in the trunk
that is used for applying major changes to the code while preserving the
integrity of the code in the trunk. If the major changes work according
to plan, they are usually merged back into the trunk.

Tags:
-----
Tags will be a point in time on the trunk or a branch that you wish to
preserve. The two main reasons for preservation would be that either
this is a major release of the software, whether alpha, beta, RC or RTM,
or this is the most stable point of the software before major revisions
on the trunk were applied.
