This is a simple linux backdoor server and client application. The
server uses libpcap to sniff all packets that come into port 31415
and then runs a simple decryption routine to verify the packet
contains a specified password before running any commands contained
within the packet.

Some issues to consider when using this program:
================================================

Many options are hard-coded into the applications, such as the
password used for the client and server to communicate. Additionally
the masked process name is also hard-coded. These hard-coded values
are inside pkd_cap.h and can be changed to your liking.
