INSTRUCTIONS:
=============

Make sure you edit "firewall.sh" to match your current network settings.
The internal network interface should be on a different subnet than the external.


USAGE:
======

./firewall.sh {start|stop|save|restore|client}
  start   - starts the firewall and configures $LOCAL_IFACE with the following settings:
            IP Address = $LOCAL_IP
            Netmask    = $LOCAL_NETMASK
            Broadcast  = $LOCAL_BCAST
  stop    - stops the firewall
  save    - saves current iptables rules to `pwd`/iptables-save
  restore - restures saved iptables rules from `pwd`/iptables-save
  client  - configures the client's $CLIENT_IFACE with the follwing settings:
            IP Address = $CLIENT_IP
            Netmask    = $CLIENT_NETMASK
            Broadcast  = $CLIENT_BCAST
            Gateway    = $CLIENT_GATEWAY"

If you want the firewall to automatically start on boot, run the following command after starting the firewall:
/etc/init.d/iptables save

Make sure iptables is set to start on boot.
