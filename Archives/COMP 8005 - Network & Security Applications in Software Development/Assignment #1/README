System Functionality:
=====================

Both the "process" and "thread" program work without issue on
Mac OS X 10.6 and FreeBSD 8.0. After testing on Ubuntu 9.10, the
programs will produce an error stating "Bad file descriptor" when
trying to write to the FIFO.


Compiling:
==========

1. Go to the "Source" directory.
2. Type "make"
