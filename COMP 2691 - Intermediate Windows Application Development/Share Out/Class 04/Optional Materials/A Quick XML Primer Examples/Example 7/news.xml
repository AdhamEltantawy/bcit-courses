    <p>Local nerd author Michael Morrison broke his ankle today while
    skateboarding on a ramp at an undisclosed location. This injury comes
    as a considerable blow to Morrison considering that he recently
    emerged from retirement to make another go at skateboarding. Against
    the wishes of friends of family, Morrison decided to to return to
    skateboarding where risk is a fact of life. His terse response to the
    injury was <quote>I don't think my ankle was supposed to bend that
    way</quote>.</p>

    <p>Witnesses to the accident recall the gruesome aftermath. Fellow skater
    and witness Darin Masters said <quote>his ankle was twisted around like
    one of those little balloon animals</quote>. While out of commission for
    a few months, Mr. Morrison has vowed to make yet another return to the
    sport.</p>
