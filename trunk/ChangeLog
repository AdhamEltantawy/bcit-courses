		Created an Anjuta project to aid in development of the project. Anjuta
		is simply an IDE, which you can install via apt-get install anjuta.

		scripts as well as some automatic dependency resolution.

		Created standard GNU project layout and added LGPL headers to all
		relavant files.

		See the README file for how to compile via command line.

		* callback.c: created to handle Gtk+ GUI event signals
		* callback.h: created for callback function definitions

		* main.c: replaced spaces with tabs
