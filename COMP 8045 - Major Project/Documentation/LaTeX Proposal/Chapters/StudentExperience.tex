Prior to my time at BCIT, my computer programming skills were entirely self-taught. As such, it has been my objective at BCIT to formalize and hone my skills with respect to computer programming as well as expanding my knowledge into other sub-disciplines, such as data communications and network security.

Ultimately, upon graduation, my goal is to seek employment in the field of *NIX/BSD systems programming with a focus on data communications. With this goal in mind, I have constructed an experimental practicum with a focus on the skills that I have learnt during my tenure at BCIT.
