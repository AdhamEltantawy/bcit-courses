COMPILING:
In order to compile this program, you need the GTK+2.0 developer libraries installed.
With the proper libraries installed, you should be able to compile the program by
issuing the following command:

$> make

BUGS:
I have yet to figure out why clients that don't have focus have a large delay
in displaying received text. To see the text immediately, move your mouse
over the window and it should appear.

If you try and run the program on localhost without an internet connection, the
application will segfault.
