Please note that these applications were created using Objective-C and the Cocoa framework. The only way they can be compiled is on a computer running Mac OS X 10.5 or greater with Xcode 3.2 installed.

REQUIREMENTS:
=============

1. Mac OS X 10.6 (10.5 may work, but it has not been tested).

2. Xcode 3.2

COMPILATION:
============

1. Acquire the use of a computer running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The projects may compile on Mac OS X 10.5, but it has not been tested.

2. Download and install Xcode 3.2 from developer.apple.com.

3. Open "./FileClient/FileClient.xcodeproj" and "./FileServer/FileServer.xcodeproj" in Xcode 3.2 and press the "Build and Debug" button in each project to launch the applications.

4. Alternatively, press COMMAND+B in each project to build them and then navigate to the "build/Debug" folder to launch the applications without Xcode.


INSTALLATION:
=============

1. Follow the compilation steps outlined above.

2. Navigate to the "./FileClient/build/Debug/" or "./FileServer/build/Debug" folder and drag "FileClient" or "FileServer" to a folder of your choosing. Normally the folder one drags applications into is "/Applications", but it is doubtful one would want to permenantly install these applications. =p
